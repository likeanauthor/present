      Next clue
    </h1>
    <code>
      It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a U.S. Army captain.
    </code>

    <!-- Of course you know how to view source code, but could you edit it?
         May be you the one, who will come up with better solution?

         Next clue:

         Page host.

         But with one remark, host doesn't accept 9 symbols as password.
         So I put cats amount to get 10.
